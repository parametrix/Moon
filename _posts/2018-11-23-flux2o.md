Flux2o is a full-fledged technology demonstrator of a workflow spanning Autodesk Revit and the Grasshopper plugin for Rhino3d using a Web Application as the intermediary.

## Description
The Wall Angle Checker was comissioned by a firm for a very large project with several walls with non-standard angles.
The tool is designed to identify elements for review and correction on a view-by-view basis.

## Features
* Text file to store approved angles for walls in a project
* Fast detection of off-angle walls because the app works only on the current view
* Ability to choose highlight colors
* Tolerances can be varied according to the needs of the project
* Prevents occurrence of Off-Axis Warnings in the project
* Can be extended to detect off-angle model lines and room separation lines
